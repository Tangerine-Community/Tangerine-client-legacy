A tablet/phone application for assessing students

Tangerine is a couchapp (http://couchapp.org/page/index) that uses 
couchdb (http://couchdb.apache.org/) for a more streamlined process

#### Getting Started - Mac
This guide is for snow leopard (Mac OS 10.6.x)

##### 1. Install xcode, homebrew, git and ruby
<http://moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/>

Use the command
    brew doctor
to make sure everything is correct. When you have all the above installed 
and brew reports "Raring to Brew" you should be ready to move on.
Some known problems that can occur:
- Problem: Problem with the pathing of redundant config files. 
- Solution: Solved by moving them away from the root directory. 

- Problem: Error running 'make'
- Solution: Run all the updates for brew, git, ruby, etc.

##### 2. Install additional programs:
Couchapp
    sudo brew install pip
    sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64" pip install couchapp

Coffeescript compiler:

Ruby
    rvm install 1.9.3

Watchr
    gem install watchr

Rake
    gem install rake


##### 3. Build couchdb

Follow the instructions on this page to install CouchDB:

<http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Installing_on_OSX>

##### 4. Ensure that couchdb is running
Go to the couchdb server that should now be running on your machine:

http://localhost:5984/_utils

##### 5. Get Tangerine
Using github create a local clone of the tangerine repository.

    git clone https://github.com/Tangerine-Community/Tangerine.git

##### 6. Deploy the tangerine source code to your local CouchDB
Go to the Tangerine directory that you just cloned into and push:

    cd Tangerine
    couchapp push

(TODO: may need to deal with .couchapprc and .couchappignore)

Check that it is working by going to <http://localhost:5984/tangerine/_design/tangerine/index.html>

If not check for error message from your couchapp push command. You can also look at the couchdb log file.

##### 7. Setup automatic pushing
From the Tangerine directory run:
    watchr file.watchr

watchr will watch all files in your Tangerine directory. When they change it will compile any coffeescript that has been updated and then push the changes to the couchdb.

#### Getting Started - Windows (TODO)

- Use a virtual box to run linux
- Use a windows build of couchdb and cygwin for python and ruby
